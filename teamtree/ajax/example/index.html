<!-- Post vs Get

Only use this if you want to get something from a server, like information e.g. Tweets

Post: use if you're sending data that's going to be saved.  -->

<!-- we're after dynamic or changing information

you need to send the server info if you wnat to get info from them. 

the data in a query string is used to search a database or server for the information that you need

Query strings can be made up of one or more name/value pairs

Query strings can hold multiple name/value pairs

&(%26) Space(+) +(%2B) all have meaning in the query string

url-encode-decode.com is a good place to check this out -->
<!-- 
The GET method is a good way to send info to a server. IE can only handle 2083 characters in a query string

That's why we can use Post. Post won't expose the data in a query string like GET will

Post sends data in the body of the request 
you can send more info as well but you need to set up a specific header -->
<!-- 
After you send an AJAX request, your callback function waits for a response, typically a text response

You can use AJAX to request a static file

YOu should have a structured data format for responses from the server. 

You can use XML (extensible markup language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to keep track of this data

XML is like HTML

<contacts>
  <contact>
    <name>Andrew</name>
    <phone>503-555-1212</phone>
  </contact>
  <contact>
    <name>Jim</name>
    <phone>615-555-1212</phone>
  </contact>
</contacts>

Most server side languages handle XML well -->

<!-- Same Origin Policy

ways to circumvent

-Web Proxy
  -use Ruby or PHP to talk to a proxy

  -JSONP - JSON with Padding

  a CDN will allow you to go to another server desipite having a different source

  CORS- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

  -Allows server to accept request from other domains

  -AJAX doesn't work unless you have a web server. Local Hosts won't work -->
